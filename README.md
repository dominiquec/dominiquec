# Well, hello there!

I am Dom Cimafranca, an inveterate dabbler in IT and computers.  My experience with compters dates back to the late 1970s
and I have worked with almost everything from PCs, mini-computers, mainframes, embedded computers, mobile, and now cloud computing.

# Stuff I am currently learning
Even though I am close to retirement age, I am still picking up new things.  Currently on my list for the coming year are:
- Event-Driven Systems
- Continuous Delivery
- Data Engineering and Analytics
- Low-Code / No-Code Development
